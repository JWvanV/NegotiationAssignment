\subsection{Domain}
\label{sec:domain}
Each group had to define their own negotiation domain, complete with multiple issues. Our group chose to create the 'Purchasing a Car' domain. This domain has a total of five issues, each with a number of issue values ranging from two to four (see Table \ref{tab:domainissues}).

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{The domain issues and issue values.}
\label{tab:domainissues}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Power (hp) & Capacity & Mileage (km) & Fuel consumption (km/l) & Wheels \\
\hline
less than 200 & 2 & Below 10.000 & 5 & 3 \\
200 or more & 5 & Between 10.000 and 20.000 & 10 & 4 \\
& 7 & Above 20.000 & 15 & 6 \\
& & & 20 & \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


In this domain nine preference profiles are created in three sets of three each. Profiles 1, 2 and 3 will negotiate with one another, as will 4,5 and 6 and so on. The first three profiles are negotiating in a collaborative scenario, the second set is a moderate scenario and the last three profiles clash in a competitive scenario. The specific values of the preference profiles can be found in section \ref{sec:attached_preference_profiles}.
