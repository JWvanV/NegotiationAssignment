\section{Conclusions}

We quite enjoyed discussing about the different actions our agent might take in different situations. As this was very close to real life, we could just think ``what would I do?'', and discuss about that. It all seemed very intuitive to us. It was also fun to invent and implement our own smart analyzing tools, like the OpponentUtilityModel. This way it really feels like we are making a smart person to analyze the opponent and do the negotiation for us.

In order to be able to support human negotiations in the real world, our agent would need to understand some sort of input, and provide even more extensive output, to let the human know how he is reasoning. Apart from that, we think this agent is already quite versatile, as it can deal with various situations and always seems to find its way. The testing part may prove otherwise though, we are curious about that.

To really take over the human negotiation, it would be nice to have some form of computer vision as well, to be able to recognize facial expressions in the opponents, and use that to determine their mood and their feelings regarding an offer. Apart from this, it should probably also be able to handle multiple offers at the same time, as human negotiation is unfortunately less structured than agent negotiation.
