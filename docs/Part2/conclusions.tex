\section{Conclusions and recommendations}
After all the tests we have performed, we can conclude that our agent was a bit to tolerant at first, and after tweaking some of the parameters to make it less tolerant, it performed better for itself, and even improved the social wellfare a bit.
\\\\
For future improvements, the changes mentioned in section \ref{sec:strategy-changes} could still be implemented. When it turns out that this agent is good enough to make it to the ANAC, we will certainly do that.
