\section{Conclusions and recommendations}
After all the tests we have performed, we can conclude that our agent was a bit to tolerant at first, and after tweaking some of the parameters to make it less tolerant, it performed better for itself, and even improved the social wellfare a bit.
\\\\
For future improvements, the changes mentioned in section \ref{sec:strategy-changes} could still be implemented. When it turns out that this agent is good enough to make it to the ANAC, we will certainly do that.

Lastly, we would recommend for the upcoming years to improve the testing experience. We would have liked to define a set of test cases which we could have ran every time we made adjustments to the code. Currently we had to configure and run 60 individual tournament setups, which in total (with 2 computers) took about 40 minutes in total. The reason for these 60 individual setups was that we only wanted to test the specific cases we were interested in (seen that opponent 2 took up to 23 minutes for a single run), and not have to also wait for a test where opponent 2 would take on opponent 4, for example.
