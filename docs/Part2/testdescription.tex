\section{Test Description}

After finishing the first version of our own negotiation agent, we were provided with the negotiation agents of other groups and their domains.

10 tournaments, for every enemy-profilecombination, testing all combinations so 2^3 = 8 sessions per tournament. - Testing every opponent on their own domain (Exception: not 9, and 10 tested on 12-domain, also ignoring sessions n/n/n and 11/11/11 in testing). Also, averaging over all sessions and domain types.

Also note that averages are only taken when agreements are reached. Meaning that there is less data for opponent 2, 6, 7 and 10
