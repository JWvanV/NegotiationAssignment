\section{Introduction to assignment}

As part of the TU Delft course IN4010 Artificial Intelligence Techniques completion of a practical assignment on automated negotiation is required. This is the assignment report of group 11, of which the group members are Hidde Coehoorn, Ralf Nieuwenhuizen and Jan-Willem van Velzen.\\

The subject of the assignment is multilateral negotiation taking place in a multi-issue negotiation domain with discrete issues. The challenge is to design and implement a negotiating agent in GENIUS which can guide the negotiation process and help the parties involved with reaching a satisfying agreement. Various scenarios are created to test the agent, ranging in the degree of conflict between parties.\\

\section*{Report requirements and checklist}

10 A4 pages may be enough, 15 A4 pages maximum\\
The report should include:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \st{the group number}
\item \st{an introduction to the assignment}
\item \st{a high-level description of the agent and its structure, including the main Java methods (mention
these explicitly!) used in the negotiating agent that have been implemented in the source code}
\item \st{an explanation of the negotiation strategy, decision function for accepting offers, any important
preparatory steps, and heuristics that the agent uses to decide what to do next, including the factors
that have been selected and their combination into these functions}
\item a section documenting the tests you performed to improve the negotiation strength of your agent.
You must include scores of various tests over multiple sessions that you performed while testing
your agent. Describe how you set up the testing situation and how you used the results to modify
your agent
\item \st{a conclusion in which you summarize your experience as a team with regards to building the
negotiating agent and discuss what extensions are required to use your agent in real-life negotiations
to support (or even take over) negotiations performed by humans.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The final analysis report should involve an elaborate analysis of your agent's performance from different perspectives (e.g. individual utility gained, social welfare - the sum of utilities of all agents, optimality of the outcome, fairness etc.). NU NOG NIET NODIG}
